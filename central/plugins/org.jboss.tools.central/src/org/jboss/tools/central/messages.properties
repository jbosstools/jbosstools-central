SoftwarePage_earlyAccessSection_Title=Early-Access Features
SoftwarePage_earlyAccessSection_message=Early-Access features are features that are NOT supported, and NOT guaranteed to work \
correctly in your IDE. However, they can provide some interesting features that are still being developed, and that the most \
eager developers or contributors may want to try without waiting. So use them at your own risk!
SoftwarePage_earlyAccessSection_checkbox=I understand those pitfalls, and I still want to access Early-Access features.
