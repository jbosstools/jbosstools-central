SoftwarePage_earlyAccessSection_message=Early Access features contain new functionality and/or fixes that are under development. \
You are encouraged to use these features and to give feedback but be aware that these features are NOT officially supported, \
NOT guaranteed to work correctly, and subject to removal from JBoss Central at any time, for any reason. Use them at your own risk!\n\
\n\
An Early Access update site will be added to the list of Available Software Sites, and may then be used to resolve dependencies \
or provide newer versions of software when performing an update or install.\n\

I understand these conditions, and still want to enable Early Access features.
